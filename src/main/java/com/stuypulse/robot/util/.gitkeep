PID is feedback, takes setpoint and measurement and uses error and input to provide an output
Feedforward calclates velocity and position without measurements 

PID is reactive to error and caan react to distrubances
Feedfoward cannot respond to error at all but doesnt need measurement

For velocity, use feedword to get measurments to calculate for error for PID

For position, use  motion profiling and a plan.
